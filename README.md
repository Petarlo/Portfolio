# Portfolio

## Description

The aim of this project was to build a personal portfolio for me to showcase my work to prospective employers. It will also allow me to track my progress by viewing my applications in physical form, rather then just code.

During the process I was sketched out the basis of my webpage, based on the sample portfolio in the task ReadMe.    
I then built the HTML code according to that layout and attempted to incorportate the CSS afterwards.

CSS is definatley something I need to practice more. I'm not entirely satisfied with the outcome but I believe it gives me a decent starting point to improve.
